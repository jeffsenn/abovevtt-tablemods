My live view table mods for AboveVTT

I have a D&D table we use for live game sessions.

It uses the excellent https://github.com/cyruzzo/AboveVTT

Here are some mods I'm applying to add functionallity to optimize for my table -- instead of continuing to bother the devs for changes :-).

Configure with some sort of Chrome extension that can tweak CSS and JS on a URL.
I use this one (now requires dev mode): https://tenrabbits.github.io/user-js-css-docs/

Set it up for a URL pattern:

My table uses a small keypad.
It use the number keys for table dice rolling.

(todo: describe dice rolling better.  Maybe a video?)

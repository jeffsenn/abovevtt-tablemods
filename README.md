My live view table mods for AboveVTT

I have a D&D table we use for live game sessions.
It uses the excellent AboveVTT.
Here are some mods I'm applying to add functionallity to optimize for my table.

Configure with a Chrome extension that can tweak CSS and JS on a URL.

Set it up for a URL pattern:

https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters*abovevtt=true

My table uses a small keypad.

Use numbers for table dice rolling.

(todo: describe this better.  Maybe a video?)
